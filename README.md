# AntiBedrockCreeper

This simple Bedrock Script helps me to understand Minecraft Bedrock Edition's Scripting System.
It will stop Creepers from Exploding even if Mob-Griefing is turned on.

# Why? There is a Mob-Griefing option...

Mob-Griefing turnes of the Griefing for every Mob... This Script doesn't.
