# AntiBedrockCreeper

This simple Bedrock Behavior Pack helps me to understand Minecraft Bedrock Edition's Scripting/Behavior System.
It will stop Creepers from Exploding even if Mob-Griefing is turned on.

Note:
While i was developing I noticed that you can't do that with scripts. So I did it with the creeper.json.

# Why? There is a Mob-Griefing option...

Mob-Griefing turnes of the Griefing for every Mob... This Pack doesn't.
A creeper will still explode when he gets lit with a flint and steel.

# The Script doesnt work and my World has been Griefed...

Make sure to activate Experimental Gameplay next time! ðŸ˜‰
